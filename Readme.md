## Description: 
In this project I am creating a more intuitive professional portfolio through react with multiple pages which stands as a massive improvement over previous iterations. 

## Usage:
upon opening the app you will be greeted with an about me screen, in the upper right corner there will be navigational tabs that can take you other pages of the app.

## Installation: 
Though this application is deployed to heroku if you are running it in vscode you will need to install react and react-router-dom 

## Testing:
This particular application doesnt have any specialized testing involved so a user may test it in the same way it's used.
